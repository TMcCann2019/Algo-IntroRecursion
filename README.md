# Algo Club: Introduction to Recursion

## Objectives

By the end of today's Algo Club, you will be able to iteratively and recursively code two common algorithms, the exponent and Fibonacci sequence algorithms. You will also be able to explain what recursion is.

## Lesson Plan

1. Write an iterative function to solve the exponent of a base and a power.
2. Write a recursive function to solve the exponent of a base and a power.
    - What is a **recursive function**? a function that is called upon itself multiple times
    - What are the two parts of a **recursive function**? Base case(simplest version of the recursion) and recursive case(calls itself)
3. Write an iterative function to solve the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence.
4. Write a recursive function to solve the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence.
